# hello-world

This is my hello world repository for GitHub I am a mechanical engineer by education. I am interested in all facets of automation. My experience is limited to VBA (primarily excel), CNC programming, and robotics programming. I am a noob to Java, Python, and Javascript which I have began to tinker with.

I am excited to learn how GitHub is involved in all of this.
